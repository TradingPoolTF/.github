# ‚ùå The Sordid Tale of "xen" and `TradingPoolTF`  
_this `README` was written by [@zudsniper](https://gh.zod.tf) on github, and "zod" [on steam](https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198071374501/)[^1]_

### ‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER ‚ö†Ô∏è  

</div>  

I am expressly **NOT** an impartial party in this situation. The individual who is discussed has been both my employer (under the table), for a short time my friend, and then my very unstable boss who would make significant threats, and finally the person who has directly the most hatred towards me online by attempting (and failing) to leverage his online reputation (lol, his ***previously positive*** online reputation).  
The intention of this is to document, but obviously, my bias is inherently present. 
#### Please keep that in mind while you come to your own conclusions, if any, via information presented in this document.    

With that out of the way, let's begin.

## üëÄ SITUATION 
> _This isn't exhaustive, just a summary of events -- I don't have time to make something like that._

### TIMELINE 
> _i don't know how to organize this and I should really get back to work fuuuu_  
   - **xen** approaches **zod** <sup>(me)</sup> to create trading platform with the main focus being "web3."  
   - **xen** SENDS **zod** 50 KEYS just to get his attention -- attention paid for -- **zod** listens to his idea.   
       during these interactions, **xen** was *exceptionally* kind, respectful, and seemingly impressed by my previous work history & community presence / contributions. He belabored his interest, which after the fact I would assume was just a tactic to curry favor. Worked.  
   - **xen**'s idea sucks. It has no real market value, and **xen** just repeats buzzwords and goes on and on and on and on and on and- about how "this is going to be huge mate" or "you don't even understand bro... I've just spoke to my shareholders..." *(his friend named `REDACTED`)* and statements to that effect.
   -  **zod** NOTABLY STILL AGREES TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROJECT, ACCEPTS FURTHER PAYMENT, AND DOES FURTHER (fairly extensive) WORK FOR **xen**, WITH THE PERSONAL OPINION THAT HIS CONCEPT WAS DOOMED[^2].  
   - **xen** and **zod** begin close daily hours long voice call communication, wherein (from my point of view), most of the time I am simply still there because he wanted to keep flexing his _massive crypto wealth_ and his _prowess in the markets_ <sup><i>(this is later confirmed by a long-time now-ex friend of **xen** to not be an accurate representation of his life situation -- the wealth was months old.)</i></sup> and talking about how this project would somehow revolutionize the TF2 economy...
   - **zod** behaved as a yesman to this[^3].
   - **zod** begins architecting the application structure with very little actual substance to go on.
   - **xen** PAYS 200 KEYS for this work -- **making the assumption that this would cover the ENTIRETY of the system architecture**, AND ***that it would be finished that night***.
```
... to be continued ...

[^1]: Permalink even though I don't change my custom url because this dude that I'll be discussing might attempt to use something like this against me in some (convoluted, ineffective) way.  
[^2]: Do with this as you will. 
[^3]: I sincerely, sincerely regret this as it caused me to damage my relationship with much less awful human beings via my unfounded loyalty to -- due to financial incentive -- **xen**. I am very sorry to my friends or ex-friends who I hurt in this debacle.
